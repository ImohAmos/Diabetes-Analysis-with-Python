## Introduction

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Objective
Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.


## Summary of Findings
- Glucose doesnt really have a direct impact on skin thickness because as it increases,,skin thickness stays constant
- Most of the observations lie between 60 and 80 i.e. majority of people had their BloodPressureworld between 60 and 80. The distribution is symmetric and has a bell shape. A distribution of this sort is a normal distribution.
- From the analysis,22 women have their 'BloodPressure' equal to the median of 'BloodPressure' which is 72 and their 'BMI' less than the median of 'BMI'which is 32.
- There is a positive relationship between Glucose and insulin. as insulin increases,glucose increases.
- Women between the ages of 20 to 30 years have higher frequency of Diabetes and as the age range increases, the frequency drops gradually.
from the distribution of ages of women who dont have diabetes,we also see that the frequency of thos who dont have diabetes is lower in the older ages.
