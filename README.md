# Diabetes-Analysis-with-Python
Here, I looked into the different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

#### This Project was one of my Foundations of Data Science Project during my data science course with MIT and Great Learning

## Introduction

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Objective
Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.
